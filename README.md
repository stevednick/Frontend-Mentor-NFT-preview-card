## My process

Very similair to the Order Summary challenge but more efficient this time. Sorted html then worked (mobile first) top to bottom on the html through the CSS.

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (a little)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pixel Perfect (for Mac)

### What I learned

I was more efficient than in the first challenge, getting a feeling for positioning and sizing elements using rem. I used a tool called Pixel Perfect which can hover a translucent version of the image you want over what you're working on. Which makes getting sizing and spacing much easier.

Just worked on solidifying everything I learned from my first project. Got a bit stuck trying to recreate the shadow behind the card and learned a lot about box-shadows in the process...

### Continued development

Going to work my way through some of the Junior projects and one or two with some JavaScript.
